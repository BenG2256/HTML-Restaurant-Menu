        <h2> Origin Story</h2>
        <img src="assets\images\about.jpg" alt="about us">
        <p>In the heart of Canada's vibrant and multicultural city, Toronto, stood a passionate chef named Henry, whose love for authentic Thai cuisine knew no bounds.
             Having grown up in Thailand, Henry had inherited a deep appreciation for the rich flavors and aromatic spices that characterized his homeland's culinary delights.
              However, upon moving to Canada, he couldn't help but notice a void in the local dining scene when it came to truly authentic Thai food.
               Inspired by his own memories of family gatherings and the joy that Thai cuisine brought to people, Henry embarked on a mission to share his heritage with the world.
                With unwavering determination, he opened the doors of "H-Thai_ML,"
                his dream restaurant named after his initials, to introduce the diverse community of Toronto to the genuine tastes of Thailand.
                 The restaurant quickly became a melting pot of culture, where locals and visitors alike indulged in the symphony of flavors, soaking in the warm ambiance, and experiencing the essence of Thailand right in the heart of Canada.</p>
